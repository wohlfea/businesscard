User Stories: MVP

As the creator, I want the Home and About nav links to act as tabs, so my story is revealed FAST.
As a reader, I want the portfolio to use a nice color scheme, so that it stands out visually.
User Stories: Stretch Goals

As a reader, I want project descriptions truncated to the first paragraph so that I can easily scroll though the whole list.
As a reader, I want to click the "More" button so that I can expand the entire description.
As a reader, I want projects filterable by category so that I can review just the things that interest me.
